## **Introduction:**

  This project aims to analyze railway journey data from January 1st, 2024, to April 30th, 2024. The
  
  dataset includes crucial information regarding railway card usage, journey status, delay reasons,
  
  and other relevant details. By comprehensively examining this data, we aim to uncover significant
  
  insights and patterns to improve railway operations and enhance passenger experience.

  
## **Business Outcomes:**
  
  • Improve operational efficiency by identifying delay patterns.
  
  • Enhance passenger satisfaction through better resource allocation and scheduling.
  
  • Increase revenue by understanding booking trends and passenger behavior.

  
## **Problem Statement:**
  The dataset reveals significant issues, such as high numbers of delays and missing railway card
  
  data. These issues impact operational efficiency and passenger experience.

  
## **Pain Points:**

  • Frequent delays causing passenger dissatisfaction.
  
  • Incomplete data affecting the accuracy of analysis.
  
  • Lack of insights into the reasons for delays and their impact on revenue.

  
## **Objectives:**

  **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
  
      o The dataset contains over 20,000 null values in the "Railway Card" column. These
      null values will be replaced with "Unknown" to ensure completeness.
     
      o All null values in “Reason for Delay” will be replaced with “No Delay”
     
      o All null values in “Actual Arrival Time” will be replaced with “Cancelled” or "N/A"
      or “unique time”
     
      o All necessary columns with object data types will be converted to appropriate
      date/time formats for accurate analysis.

  **2. Standardization:**
  
    o The values in the "Reason for Delay" column will be unified into specific
    categories:
    
    1. "Weather” will be “Weather Conditions,"
    
    2. "Signal failure” will be “Signal Failure,"
    
    3. and “Staffing” will be "Staff Shortage."

    
  **3. Research and Analysis:**
  
    o Conduct research on various weather conditions that affected railway journeys
    during the specified period.
    
    o Investigate the impact of public holidays on travel patterns, including increased
    bookings and revenue trends for specific destinations.
    
    o Analyze ticket types to study the behavior of passengers, particularly focusing on
    the demand for refunds and compensations in cases of cancellations or delays.

    
**By achieving these objectives, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors
influencing railway journeys and delays. The insights derived from this analysis will be
instrumental in identifying areas for improvement and implementing strategies to enhance the
overall efficiency and passenger satisfaction in railway services.**
